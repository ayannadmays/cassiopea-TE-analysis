# cassiopea-TE-analysis

This analysis uses repeatmodeler to build a custom TE database based on the genome (repeatmodeler), identifies and masks TEs found (repeatmasker), calculates the divergence of TE sequences found from regerence TEs as a proxy for age, and illustrates TE age and expansions over evolutionary time (repeatlandscape) in a landscapr chart

Four genomes of cassiopea were analyzed for this analysis

Pipeline:
-RepeatModeler
-RepeatMasker
-CalcDiv
-RepeatLandscape
